/* 

Making the custom stylesheet, well need it for unique visuals that arent covered by boostrap 5 

I used alot of AI to help me build this style sheet and did not understand it at first but overtime i was able to adapt

it has layout features for the nav bar, footers, and backgrounds, 
it has component features for the cards, buttons, badges (for tasks), and forms 
it has page specific features for attendance at the task page and for the calendar also on the tasks page
utility animations and accecibilities
and media queries
